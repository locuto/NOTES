NOTE - THESE ARE FROM THE SITE MENTIONED ABOVE

THESE ARE UNTESTED BY ME

METHOD 1

If you mean you want a new project with a new repo, but sharing history with the old one, then the simple way is

$ git clone https://github.com/your_name/old_project new_project
# make new, empty project on GitHub called new_project
$ cd new_project
$ git remote rename origin old_project
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/your_name/new_project
$ git push -u origin
Now you have a new project, but in your local clone you can still get commits from the old one 
to get bugfixes to common code with git cherry-pick etc.

METHOD 2

You need to branch

git branch <your_new_branch>
git checkout <your_new_branch>
to switch back to old branch

git checkout master
to list all branches

git branch
