GIT HOW TO CLONE AND PUSH
==========================
First, fork the main git location - from the main location like https://github.com/coderdba/NOTES
-- to another location like 'MyName' or another repository

Clone the fork
$ git clone git@github.com:fork-location/NOTES.git

$ cd requests

$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/coderdba/NOTES

$ git remote -v
origin <fork location> (push)
origin <fork location> (fetch)
upstream <base location> (push)
upstream <base location> (fetch)

$ git checkout master
Already on 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

$ git pull upstream master
Username for 'https://www.github.com': coderdba
Password for 'https://coderdba@www.github.com'
From https://git.x.com/OpenStack-x/requests
 * branch              master     -> FETCH_HEAD
 * [new branch]        master     -> upstream/master
Already up to date.

$ git checkout -b new_updates
Switched to a new branch 'new_updates'

$ git add .

$ git commit -m "new_updates"

$ git push origin new_updates

Then, go to the fork or to the main git location - and do a 'pull request'
Then, you or a reviewer should do a 'merge' of the pull request
This will make the master updated - and if there are any cicd hooks then they will run
