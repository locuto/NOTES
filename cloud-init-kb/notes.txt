There is something about /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg and /etc/cloud/templates
- see the file ./etc/cloud/cloud.cfg in this cloud-init-kb folder
- also see these sites:
  https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/2524
- When a centos base image like qcow2 is created using packer or such, a default user 'centos' gets created,
  with its details mentioned in cloud.cfg. When creating a VM using that qcow2, and via virt-install, 
  even if we mention default_user clause in user-data file, it does not write into /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg 
  - that file will still have 'centos' as the default user - maybe we should change it in cloud-init or manually
