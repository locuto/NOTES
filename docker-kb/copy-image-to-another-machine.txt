You will need to save the Docker image as a tar file:

docker save -o <path for generated tar file> <image name>
Then copy your image to a new system with regular file transfer tools such as cp or scp. After that you will have to load the image into Docker:

docker load -i <path to image tar file>
PS: You may need to sudo all commands.

EDIT: You should add filename (not just directory) with -o, for example:

docker save -o c:/myfile.tar centos:16
