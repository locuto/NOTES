docker run -d \
  --net="host" \
  --pid="host" \
  -v "/:/host:ro,rslave" \
  prom/node-exporter \
  --path.rootfs=/host

docker run -d \
-p 9100:9100 \
--user 995:995 \
-v "/:/hostfs" \
--net="host" \
prom/node-exporter \
--path.rootfs=/hostfs

-d: detached mode, will run the node exporter even if we are not directly interacting with it;
-p: as the node exporter runs on port 9100, we are going to expose this port to Prometheus;
–user: the node exporter user ID, for security purposes.
-v: the host filesystem (the machine you are monitoring) is mapped to a folder in the Docker image.
    (first part before colon is the host's fs -  and second part after the colon is the fs on the container)
–net: sets the Docker image and the host to share the same network.
–path.rootfs: instructs the node exporter to look for the filesystem in the hostfs folder. 
              This way, the Node exporter is not monitoring your Docker filesystem, but the mapped filesystem from your host.


NOTE: the -p directive is not needed if we use --net=host - you will get the warning message as below
      - it is automatic that the container's app will listen on host's same ort as container's

NOTE: also, The host networking driver only works on Linux hosts, and is not supported on Docker Desktop for Mac, 
      Docker Desktop for Windows, or Docker EE for Windows Server.
      (from https://docs.docker.com/network/host/ )
      
NOTE: The --user directive to docker is to make the container run as the user and not root (however, my user is root for now)

NOTE: --pid="host" uses host's PID namespace
