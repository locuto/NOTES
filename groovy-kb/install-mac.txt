OPENJDK - WITH BREW
============================
$ brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk
$ brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
--> This installs into /Library/java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk
--> into /usr/bin/java -> /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java
--> however, shows version as adoptopenjdk
	$ java -version
	openjdk version "1.8.0_242"
	OpenJDK Runtime Environment (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 1.8.0_242-b08)

GROOVY - WITH BREW
============================
$ brew install groovy
--> This installed 2.5.9 version
--> into /usr/local/bin/groovy -> ../Cellar/groovy/2.5.9/bin/groovy
-->      /usr/local/bin/groovysh -> ../Cellar/groovy/2.5.9/bin/groovysh and so on...

$ export GROOVY_HOME /usr/local/Cellar/groovy/2.5.9

$ groovysh
Error: Could not find or load main class org.codehaus.groovy.tools.GroovyStarter
$ groovy -version
Error: Could not find or load main class org.codehaus.groovy.tools.GroovyStarter

--> error fix
? https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/issues/250
- may need to set CLASSPATH pointing to /usr/local/Cellar/groovy/2.5.9/libexec/lib/groovy-2.5.9.jar

============================================================
ALTERNATIVE INSTALL - VERSION 2.5.9 - WITH DOWNLOADING ZIP
============================================================

https://groovy-lang.org/install.html

Install Binary

These instructions describe how to install a binary distribution of Groovy.

First, Download a binary distribution of Groovy and unpack it into some file on your local file system.
--> https://groovy-lang.org/install.html#download-groovy
--> https://bintray.com/artifact/download/groovy/maven/apache-groovy-binary-2.5.9.zip

sudo cd /opt
sudo cp ~/Downloads/apache-groovy-binary-2.5.9.zip .
sudo unzip apache-groovy-binary-2.5.9.zip
export GROOVY_HOME=/opt/groovy-2.5.9
export PATH=$GROOVY_HOME/bin:$PATH

Set your GROOVY_HOME environment variable to the directory you unpacked the distribution.

Add GROOVY_HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable.

Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK. On OS X this is /Library/Java/Home, on other unixes its often /usr/java etc. If you’ve already installed tools like Ant or Maven you’ve probably already done this step.

You should now have Groovy installed properly. You can test this by typing the following in a command shell:

groovysh
Which should create an interactive groovy shell where you can type Groovy statements. Or to run the Swing interactive console type:

groovyConsole
To run a specific Groovy script type:

groovy SomeScript

BREW INSTALL - REDO - THIS INSTALLED LATEST 3.0.2 - INSTEAD OF 2.5.9

NOTE: Also, this installed new jdk - though did not mess with JAVA_HOME and current jdk:

	--> set environment variables accordingly --> IT IS ALL SHIT

==> Caveats
For the system Java wrappers to find this JDK, symlink it with
  sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk

openjdk is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because it shadows the macOS `java` wrapper.

If you need to have openjdk first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.kshrc

For compilers to find openjdk you may need to set:
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openjdk/include"

BREW INSTALL - VERSION 2.5.9
========================================================
Installing specific versions did not work 


========================================================
INSTALL USING SDKMAN
========================================================
From - http://groovy-lang.org/install.html
Also see - https://medium.com/@czerwinb/how-to-install-a-specific-gradle-version-on-your-mac-beab35051ee8
Also see - https://sdkman.io/install

SDKMAN! (The Software Development Kit Manager)
This tool makes installing Groovy on any Bash platform (Mac OSX, Linux, Cygwin, Solaris or FreeBSD) very easy.

Simply open a new terminal and enter:

$ curl -s get.sdkman.io | bash
Follow the instructions on-screen to complete installation.

Open a new terminal or type the command:

$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
Then install the latest stable Groovy:

$ sdk install groovy 2.5.9 (this version is added by me)
After installation is complete and you’ve made it your default version, test it with:

$ groovy -version
That’s all there is to it!

-------------
AFTER THAT
-------------
PATH=/Users/username/.sdkman/candidates/groovy/current/bin:$PATH
GROOVY_HOME=/Users/username/.sdkman/candidates/groovy/2.5.9

==================
INTELLIJ
==================
Import the project folder
Right click on the project name in thr project explorer
Click 'Add Framework Support'
Choose 'groovy'
An existing framework may be already there - like what gradle may have pulled
Change the name to groovy-2.5.9-sdkman for clarity (adding -sdkman)
Click 'create'
Then a finder window (in mac) pops up
Press Shift-control-dot (or Shift-command-dot) to show hidden folders like .sdkman
Choose /Users/username/.sdkman/candidates/groovy/2.5.9
In one dropdown - we can choose if it is a 'global' or only 'project' and some other level library

Find if it got added - method1:
Go back to 'add framework support'
Then groovy should not show up

Find if it got added - method2:
File --> Project Structure --> Platform Settings --> Global Libraries
- You can view, rename, delete etc here

Note: Once a framework support is added, to add a different one for the same framework (either version or folder)
      you have to delete it and add it again 

To delete a framework: (use method 2 abobve)
