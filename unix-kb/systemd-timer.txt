FLEXIBLE TIMER WITH SINGLE SERVICE
=======================================
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.timer.html

For each timer file, a matching unit file must exist, describing the unit to activate when the timer elapses. 
By default, a service by the same name as the timer (except for the suffix) is activated. 
Example: a timer file foo.timer activates a matching service foo.service. 
The unit to activate may be controlled by Unit= (see below).

Unit=
The unit to activate when this timer elapses. The argument is a unit name, whose suffix is not ".timer". 
*****If not specified, this value defaults to a service that has the same name as the timer unit, "except for the suffix." (See above.) 
It is recommended that the unit name that is activated and the unit name of the timer unit are named identically, 
except for the suffix.

That is,
Syntax:
The service file:  service_name@.service
Timer file: service_name@suffix.timer
Suffix is sent to the service as argument
The ExecStart script/program can get that argument as %i to it and use it (see examples below)

Example:
The service file: localrepo_pull_yum@.service
Timer1 file: localrepo_pull_yum@centos-7:base.timer  (suffix is centos-7:base)
Timer2 file: localrepo_pull_yum@fedora-29:fedora.timer  (suffix is fedora-29:fedora)

File contents:

Service file: localrepo_pull_yum@.service
- Notes:
%i is the 'suffix' like centos-7, fedora-29 and such
localrepo_yum_pull is a script that takes the %i argument and pulls stuff

- File Content:

[Unit]
Description=Yum repo pull to local repo
After=syslog.target network.target var-www-repos.mount docker.service
[Service]
Type = simple
User = root
EnvironmentFile = -/etc/localrepo/yum/%i.env
ExecStart = /opt/localrepo/bin/localrepo_yum_pull %i
[Install]
...
...

Timer file: localrepo_pull_yum@centos-7:base.timer
- Notes:
OnCalendar - is the calendar schedule for this timer
The file name part "localrepo_pull_yum" aiutomatically refers to the service localrepo_pull_yum@.service
The suffix centos-7:base is sent to the service localrepo_pull_yum@.service

- File Content:
[Unit]
Description=Yum repo pull timer to local repo
After=syslog.target network.target var-www-repos.mount docker.service
[Timer]
OnCalendar = *-*-* 19:00:00
RandomizedDelaySec=1800
Persistent = true
[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
