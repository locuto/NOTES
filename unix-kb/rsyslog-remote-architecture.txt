Configure a RHEL/Centos server as remote logger server

Local server rsyslog from cell servers --> send via rsyslog.conf method to a remote logger (no fancy stuff)
(do this also for audit records)

Remote logger --> rsyslog-cfc-exadata-cell.conf to filter cell records only and send to kafka or logstash
(ensure both rsyslog messages and audit records are sent)
