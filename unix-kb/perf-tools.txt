LINUX/UNIX PERFORMANCE TOOLS


PSTREE
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/82440
yum install psmisc

Then use commands like:
# pstree

# for i in `seq 1 5`; do pstree -lspT 54321; sleep 1; done

LINUX TOOLS 1

Parallel SSH and Cluster SSH: The pssh and cssh tools allow SSH access to multiple nodes. This is useful for inspections and cluster wide changes.
Passwordless SSH: SSH authentication is carried out by using public and private keys. This allows SSH connections to easily hop from node to node without password access. In cases where more security is required, you can implement a bastion host and/or VPN.
Useful common command-line tools include:
dstat: Shows all system resources instantly. For example, you can compare disk usage in combination with interrupts from your IDE controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers directly with the disk throughput (in the same interval).
top: Provides an ongoing look at CPU processor activity in real time.
System performance tools: Tools such as iostat, mpstat, iftop, sar, lsof, netstat, htop, vmstat, and similar can collect and report a variety of metrics about the operation of the system.
vmstat: Reports information about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps, and CPU activity.
iftop: Shows a list of network connections. Connections are ordered by bandwidth usage, with the pair of hosts responsible for the most traffic at the top of list. This tool makes it easier to identify the hosts causing network congestion.

MEMORY BY PROCESS
ps aux --> gives VSZ as memory used by process

VMSTAT
vmstat 2 10
--> every 2 seconds 10 times
vmstat 2
--> every 2 seconds continuously
