Update brew:
brew doctor
brew update

Install psql tools:
brew install libpq

Finally, symlink psql (and other libpq tools) into /usr/local/bin:
brew link --force libpq ail

Linking:

$ brew link --force libpq
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/libpq/12.2_1... 370 symlinks created

If you need to have this software first in your PATH instead consider running:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.kshrc
  
$ which psql
/usr/local/bin/psql

$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/psql
lrwxr-xr-x  1 dbgsm0  admin  31 Apr  7 09:39 /usr/local/bin/psql -> ../Cellar/libpq/12.2_1/bin/psql
