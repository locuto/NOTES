After clicking on "Report...", it was always clear the VirtualBox caused the crash as I could see the message 
BSD process name corresponding to current thread: VirtualBoxVM.

To solve, first I've tried to downgrade/upgrade my VirtualBox to another release or the latest version but the problem
persisted. So, I've realized that this problem was somehow related to the parameters of my VM. So I started playing 
with them making all possible combinations of:

Reducing my VM to less or a single CPU.
Changing my VM Chipset. (default PIIX3 - under motherboard)
Disabling PAE/NX. (default enabled - under processor)
Disabling Nested Paging. (default enabled - under acceleration)
Changing Paravirtualization Interface. (default 'Default' - under acceleration)
So the only one that really solved my problem and stopped those randoms Kernel Panic was the last one, changing Paravirtualization Interface to None.



Finally the crashes were resolved. By the way, I didn't notice any performance reduction after changing that, 
so this is how my VMs are defined from now on my Mac.
