Adding a host to an existing inventory: https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/9rb3nb/adding_a_host_to_ansible_tower_inventory_through/

ADD A HOST TO AN INVENTORY
==========================

https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/9rb3nb/adding_a_host_to_ansible_tower_inventory_through/

Create a payload.json file that looks something like this:

{
    "name": "localhost",
    "description": "this is a test host added via API",
    "enabled": true,
    "instance_id": "",
    "variables": "ansible_connection: local"
}
Then here's an example curl command:

curl -u {USER}:{PASS} -X POST -d @payload.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k https://www.example.com/api/v2/inventories/{INV_ID}/hosts/

=======================================
CREATE AN INVENTORY WITH SCM/GIT SOURCE
=======================================
NOTE: The API reference does not have doc on how to add a source to an inventory. 
(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/towerapi/api_ref.html#/ is the API reference)

However, the URL works (find URL as below)
- Get the URL from an existing inventory by doing api/v2/inventories/{id}
-- That will show the URL "inventory_sources": "/api/v2/inventories/{id}/inventory_sources/"
   Click that and you will know all properties/post-data to be provided
   
APIs:
POST /api/v2/inventories/ - create an inventory
POST /api/v2/inventories/{id}/inventory_sources/ - Create a source for an Inventory

1. CREATE THE INVENTORY (EMPTY INVENTORY)
NOTE: Organization '2' is the key for the organization - not the name (do a GET on organizations to find the key)
NOTE: The python call is to format the output properly

$ curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer abcdefgTOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST  \
-d '{"name":"pye-prod-001","description":"pye-prod-001","organization":"2","kind":""}'        \
https://110.160.151.4/api/v2/inventories/      | python -m json.tool

2. ADD INVENTORY SOURCE TO THE INVENTORY
NOTE: The source path is the actual path of the file in AWX repo - which is the one downloaded from git by the 'project'
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer abcdefgTOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST            \
-d '{"name":"prod-001.inv","description":"prod-001.inv from  k8s playbook", \
"source":"scm","source_project":"6","update_on_project_update":"true","overwrite":"true", \
"overwrite_vars":"true","source_path":"/var/lib/awx/projects/_6__k8s_playbook_repo/inv/pye/prod-001.inv"}' \

This is incorrect information:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37503408/creating-an-inventory-source-using-ansible-tower-rest-api
--> Per this site, first we have to create a group and then add a source to the inventory in it...??
    I ultimately found an answer to this problem- you cannot create a new inventory source by the current API. 
    Instead, it is created for you when you create an inventory group. 
    To edit this inventory source, you can find its ID (in the related fields for the inventory group you created), 
    and make a PUT request to edit.

    The easiest approach I found to testing was to use the Web Interface and my Browser's Network Inspector, 
    as I could see what API calls were being made as I performed particular tasks.
 
Something like this:
1. first create an inventory
2. add the source to this inventory
2. CREATE A GROUP FOR THE INVENTORY (with same name as the inventory for convenience)
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer abcdefgTOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST  \
-d '{"name":"pye-prod-001","description":"pye-prod-001"}'        \
