======================================================
AWX JOB SETUP - FIRST STEPS
======================================================

========================
CREDENTIALS
========================

Set up the following type of credentials:

1. Git (URL, username, key/password)
    - Choose 'scm' as the type of credential (scm=source code management)
    
2. Host access (like ssh key of host)
--> NOTE: For a group of hosts in 'inventory' the key should be same
    - Choose the type host

3. ansible vault password
    - Choose the type vault

========================
INVENTORY
========================
Add your hosts to lists of hosts

========================
PROJECT (git)
========================
Add your git project - like "git - ansible-telegraf-roles"
Give SCM credential for AWX to logon to git

NOTE: 
Caution: If no option is set - this has to be manually synched upon changes to Git repo
Fix: Choose the option 'UPDATE REVISION ON LAUNCH' and provide a cache timeout of about 120 sec


========================
JOB TEMPLATE
========================
Choose Templates --> job template
Add a job template to run one of the projects.
- Give the following
-- inventory
-- project (the git project)
-- playbook - the yml file to run from the repo (one may have more than one run-yml and choose which you want)
-- credential - of the hosts  (only one credential can be chosen - so all hosts in the inventory should have the same key)
-- forks - number of parallel processes (not same as job slicing)
-- limit - limit on which hosts to run (comma separated or pattern - as per ansible standard)
-- job tags - tags you want to use (like base, etcd, telegraf and such)
-- job slicing - running multiple jobs intrinsically, each on a portion of inventory - set this to more than 1 if ok
-- OPTIONS
        - Enable privilege escalation (to root) - check this 
        - Allow provisioning callbacks (not very sure what this is) - did not check this
        - Enable concurrent jobs - check this
        - Use fact cache - did not check this

========================
SCHEDULE JOB
========================
NOTE: Date defaults to 'tomorrows' date - take a look and choose correct date

In the job template itself - choose 'SCHEDULE' button - and, add a schedule
