===================================
REMOVING PACKAGES (RPMS)
===================================
If a rpm is built with 'requires' directive
- it installs that required package during install of the rpm (install the built rpm with "yum install package_name")
- however, yum erase or rpm -e of that built-and-installed package does not automatically remove the 'required' package
- even if you put that remove in 'postUninstall' script, it does not help

- USUAL PACKAGE REMOVE COMMANDS
yum erase package_name
rpm -e package_name
rpm -e package_name --nodeps
rpm -e package_name --noscripts 
(this one does not fire the pre/post scripts - use it when those scripts get into chicken-and-egg situation)


- REMOVE THE PACKAGE AND THE INSTALLED-REQUIRED-PACKAGES (with additional plugin)
https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/33785/removing-packages-with-dependencies/
yum install yum-plugin-remove-with-leaves
yum remove *packagename* --remove-leaves

- ANOTHER OPTION WITH AUTOREMOVE (caution- may blindly do this for all packages)
