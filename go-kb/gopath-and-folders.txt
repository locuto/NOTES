GOPATH
=================

Defaults to ~/go

Set in environment:
export GOPATH=/mywork/golang

Imports:
-- go get and go mod will get stuff into the first one in the list 
-- go get puts stuff into src, bin subfolders (not sure of pkg subfolder)
-- go modules put stuff into pkg subfolder (not sure of src, bin)
-- cobra init command will generate the code in the 'src' folder inside first one in the list
-- can move the cobra-init kind of generated stuff onto the other GOPATH folders and use them there

Can have multiple, set in environment as below, separated by colon:
export GOPATH=~/go:/mywork/golang

If using multiple folders in GOPATH:
-- Imports use the first folder in the GOPATH

Folder structure - under GOPATH:
src is the folder where code is created
src/project1 is the project1 subfolder
src/github.com/coderdba/project2 is the folder for the github project project2 
  (this convention helps when imports from github are to be embedded)
