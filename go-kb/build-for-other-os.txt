===============
ENV VARIABLES
===============
GOOS
GOARCH
GOARM

===============
BUILD FOR LINUX -->  THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR CREATING A LINUX DOCKER IMAGE (the mac compiled version wont run in Linux)
===============
See section TROUBLESHOOT MAC COMPILED EXECUTABLE ISSUE - for troubleshooting before leading to this

Set the GOOS and GOARCH to the right OS and architecture setting and then build the project:

$ export GOOS=linux 
$ export GOARCH=amd64 
(optional? GOAARM=n a number - is it version)
$ go build
