CREATE THE HELM FOLDERS IN REPO
=================================

- Create repo directory
$ mkdir repo-name 
--> this repo may have everything like drone, python, helm and whatever

- Create helm basic components
File: repo-name/Chart.yaml:

apiVersion: v1
appVersion: "1.0"
description: Infra Local Prometheus
name: infra-local-prometheus
version: 0.1.0

File: requirements.yaml

dependencies:
  - name: prometheus
    repository: "@stable"
    version: 8.11.2

- NOW, FETCH THE EXTERNAL HELM MENTIONED IN requirements.yaml

$ cd repo-name

-- METHOD1 - helm fetch
--- FETCH LATEST
$ helm fetch stable/prometheus --untar --untardir=charts
--> This will fetch the LATEST (as we have not specified the version) 'stable' helm of prometheus 
--> from https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus
--> into repo-name/charts/prometheus
--> and untars files/folders from the tgz file already

--- FETCH SPECIFIC VERSION
$ helm fetch stable/prometheus --version 8.11.2 --untar --untardir=charts

-- METHOD2 - helm dependency update

$ helm dependency update

--> This will download the helm chart in tgz format into charts directory
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
