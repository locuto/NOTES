Remove a Kubernetes Node
This section describes how to remove a Kubernetes Node from your MCP cluster.

To remove a Kubernetes Node:

Log in to the Kubernetes Node that you want to remove.

Stop and disable the salt-minion service on this node:

systemctl stop salt-minion
systemctl disable salt-minion
Log in to the Salt Master node.

Verify that the node name is not registered in salt-key. If the node is present, remove it:

salt-key | grep <node_name><NUM>
salt-key -d <node_name><NUM>.domain_name
Log in to any Kubernetes Master node.

Mark the Node as unschedulable to prevent new pods from being assigned to it:

kubectl cordon <node_ID>
kubectl drain <node_ID>
Remove the Kubernetes Node:

kubectl delete node cmp<node_ID>
Wait until the workloads are gracefully deleted and the Kubernetes Node is removed.

Verify that the node is absent in the Kubernetes Nodes list:

kubectl get nodes
Open your Git project repository with Reclass model on the cluster level.

In infra/config.yml, remove the definition of the Kubernetes Node in question under the reclass:storage:node pillar.

Log in to the Kubernetes Node in question.

Run the following commands:

systemctl stop kubelet
systemctl disable kubelet
