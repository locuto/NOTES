1. Looks like flannel is still taking the NAT IP as host IP.
(also see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/203)
Do fix as in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47845739/configuring-flannel-to-use-a-non-default-interface-in-kubernetes
- download kube-flannel.yml
- add 'iface' directive
- And, how to do this as in that website?
And also be sure to add the following to kubelet.service: 
--node-ip={{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_enp0s8']['ipv4']['address'] }} , 
this way the correct host IPs will be matching the Pod CIDRs â€“ jonashackt Jun 21 at 13:37 

2. Check this tutorial similar to the other one we used:
https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/centos-kubernetes-docker-cluster/
--> This does flannel BEFORE NODE JOIN
