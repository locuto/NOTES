For some parts of your application (e.g. frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external (outside of your cluster) IP address.

Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of service you want. The default is ClusterIP.

Type values and their behaviors are:

ClusterIP: 
Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. 
Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster. 
This is the default ServiceType.

NodePort: 
Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort). 
A ClusterIP service, to which the NodePort service will route, is automatically created. 
You’ll be able to contact the NodePort service, from outside the cluster, by requesting <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.

LoadBalancer: 
Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer. 
NodePort and ClusterIP services, to which the external load balancer will route, are automatically created.

ExternalName: 
Maps the service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), 
by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. 
This requires version 1.7 or higher of kube-dns.
