Pod OS environment variables
- seems like we can get them right only with 'from literal' or plain basic key-value pairs in the data section.
- the 'from-file' type of configmaps seem to bring environment variables incorrectly

from-file
- mentions the file name itself in the configmap and the contents of that as properties of that file
- cannot use the contents directly as environment variables in pods - with 'env' and 'envfrom' directives

from-envfile
- kind of converts file contents to literals
- CAN use the contents directly as environment variables in pods - with 'env' and 'envfrom' directives
