HEALTH CHECK
==============================
https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/v2/admin_guide.html

- Using curl
# curl -L http://127.0.0.1:2379/health
{"health": "true"}

Also, you can use individual node IP instead of 127.0.0.1
--> do that for each node to know health of each member

- Using etcdctl

-- cluster health
# etcdctl cluster-health
member 3155d2fb633d686a is healthy: got healthy result from http://120.158.240.249:2379
member 31acc000db8fea90 is healthy: got healthy result from http://120.158.240.247:2379
member f042dd7292edb971 is healthy: got healthy result from http://120.158.240.248:2379
cluster is healthy
