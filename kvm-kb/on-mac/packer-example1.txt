Building QEMU VMs with HVF (Hypervisor.framework) acceleration

Is anyone successfully using QEMU HVF acceleration to build images on macOS? I've been experimenting with it to little success.

My target guest platform is CentOS 7.5 x86_64, running Packer 1.2.4 on macOS 10.13.5. The guest will boot but hang early after init at "dracut-initqueue".

Calling qemu-system-x86_64 directly with the Packer-generated arguments produces the same results unless I remove the arguments for both NIC and virtual disk.

Packer JSON follows. Largely cribbed from Bento.

The TL;DR is add "qemuargs": [[ "-global", "virtio-pci.disable-modern=on" ]]


I wrote the commit that added the HVF accelerator, so I am using it :-)  I saw that issue as well with RHEL 7.5.  I put this in the documentation:

The hvf accelerator is new and experimental as of QEMU 2.12.0. You may encounter issues unrelated to Packer when using it. You may need to add [ "-global", "virtio-pci.disable-modern=on" ] to qemuargs depending on the guest operating system.


Thanks,

Y'know I noticed your note in the docs, but must have fat-fingered it during my testing and chalked up the error to my QEMU build. That's what I get for multitasking.

Adding the "qemuargs" key fixed my build, thanks very much :)
