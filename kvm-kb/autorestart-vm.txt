KVM: Start a Virtual Machine / Guest At Boot Time
last updated May 6, 2017 in CategoriesCentOS, Linux KVM, RedHat and Friends, Virtualization

There are various ways to start virtual machines at at boot time. 
This means you donâ€™t have to type virsh start vmName command. 
This can be done by marking a vm as autostart. To configure a domain to be automatically started at boot. 
It will create an softlink at /etc/libvirt/qemu/autostart/. 

So if your VM name is debianlenny1, 
your  config file name should be /etc/libvirt/qemu/debianlenny1.xml and the softlink 
should be created at /etc/libvirt/qemu/autostart//debianlenny1.xml

KVM: Autostart a Domain / VM Command

Type the following command:

virsh autostart vmName
virsh autostart debianlenny1

Sample outputs:

Domain debianlenny1 marked as autostarted

Also, make sure /etc/init.d/libvirtd service is stared on boot:
chkconfig libvirtd on

OR
systemctl enable libvirtd

How do I disable autostarting a domain/VMs

The syntax is:
virsh autostart VMNameHere --disable

To disable auto starting freebsd vm, enter:
virsh autostart freebsd --disable
