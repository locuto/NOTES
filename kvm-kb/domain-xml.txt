DOMAIN XML FOR LIBVIRT
================================
https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html

domain = practically, a vm (as listed in virsh list)
vmname = name of a vm
vmpattern = patterns of vm's with global configs for all vms (???)

./run/libvirt/qemu/vmname.xml
./etc/libvirt/qemu/vmname.xml --> maybe this is the main one
./etc/libvirt/storage/autostart/vmpattern.xml
./etc/libvirt/storage/vmpattern.xml
