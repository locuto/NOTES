Create a machine to run packer
- see other notes on what packages that machine should have 

Create a 'OS base image' qcow2 (or other format) image using packer and DVD-ISO
(with packer)
- Give url or filename of the ISO file in config json
- use kickstart file for f/s and other config in config json (with a http server dynamically created by packer to serve it)
- embed root password in the builder packer config json
- install more stuff if necessary - like security packages, security mandated cron jobs (like aide) etc.
  - also like cloud-init
  - using 'scripts' directive in config json
          "scripts": [
        "scripts/install-packages-and-configure.sh"
      ]
      
Create custom images (for different purposes - K8S, Oracle, Postgress etc)
(with packer)
- Use the base image qcow2 further with packer - instead of using DVD-ISO, use the base image qcow2
- CLOUD-INIT with seed-ISO mounted
    - Change root password if necessary by embedding a new one
    - Copy files onto the VM
    - Install more packages
    - Syntax in json:
        "qemuargs": [
      [ "-m", "1024M"],
      [ "-cdrom", "seed.iso" ]
    ]

Create VMs using virt-install 
(with virt-install)
- Use the base or custom images - as needed
- Inject customizations 
  - like root password change using cloud-init ISO file as cdrom (with user-data)
    (cloud-init should be pre-installed in the image though)
- setup network with directives like
  --network bridge=br0,model=virtio \
  --network bridge=br0,model=virtio \
  --disk path=${seed_path},device=cdrom \. --> This is the CLOUD-INIT here
