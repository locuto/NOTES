22.2. The xm command line interface
The xm command is used to manage your Red Hat Virtualization environment using a CLI interface. Most operations can be performed by the virt-manager application, including a CLI interface which is part of virt-manager. However, there are a few operations which currently can not be performed using virt-manager. As the xm command is part of the Xen environment a few options available with the xm command will not work in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environment. The list below provides an overview of command options available (and unavailable) in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environment. As an alternative to using the xm command one can also use the virsh command which is provided as part of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Xen environment . The virsh command is layered on top of the libvirt API which can provide a number of benefits over using the xm command. Namely the ability to use virsh in scripts and the ability to manage other hypervisors as they are integrated into the libvirt API.


Basic management options
The following are basic and commonly used xm commands:

xm help [--long]: view available options and help text.

use the xm list command to list active domains:

$ xm list
Name                                ID  Mem(MiB)   VCPUs      State      Time(s)
Domain-0                            0     520       2         r-----     1275.5
r5b2-mySQL01                       13     500       1         -b----       16.1
xm create [-c] DomainName/ID: start a virtual machine. If the -c option is used, the start up process will attach to the guest's console.

xm console DomainName/ID: attach to a virtual machine's console.

xm destroy DomainName/ID: terminate a virtual machine , similar to a power off.

xm reboot DomainName/ID: reboot a virtual machine, runs through the normal system shut down and start up process.

xm shutdown DomainName/ID: shut down a virtual machine, runs a normal system shut down procedure.

xm pause

xm unpause

xm save

xm restore

xm migrate


Resource management options
Use the following xm commands to manage resources:

xm mem-set

use the xm vcpu-list to list virtual CPU assignments/placements:

$ xm vcpu-list
Name                          ID  VCPUs   CPU State  Time(s)  CPU Affinity
Domain-0                       0    0      0    r--   708.9    any cpu
Domain-0                       0    1      1   -b-    572.1    any cpu
r5b2-mySQL01                  13    0      1   -b-     16.1    any cpu
xm vcpu-pin

xm vcpu-set

use the xm sched-credit command to display scheduler parameters for a given domain:

$ xm sched-credit -d 0
{'cap': 0, 'weight': 256}
$ xm sched-credit -d 13
{'cap': 25, 'weight': 256}

Monitoring and troubleshooting options
Use the following xm commands for monitoring and troubleshooting:

xm top

xm dmesg

xm info

xm log

use the xm uptime to display the uptime of guests and hosts:

$ xm uptime
Name                       ID  Uptime
Domain-0                    0  3:42:18
r5b2-mySQL01               13  0:06:27
xm sysrq

xm dump-core

xm rename

xm domid

xm domname


Currently unsupported options
The xm vnet-list is currently unsupported.
