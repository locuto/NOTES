From Implementing Tagged VLAN Interfaces in Oracle VM Environments on Exadata (Doc ID 2018550.1)	

Oracle databases running in Oracle VM guests on Oracle Exadata Database Machine are accessed through 
the client Ethernet network defined in the Oracle Exadata Deployment Assistant (OEDA) configuration tool. 
Client network configuration in both the management domain (dom0) and user domains (domUs) is done automatically 
when OEDA installation tool creates the first user domain during initial deployment.

The default bonded client network configuration, as depicted in figure 1 below, is as follows:

In the dom0, eth slave interfaces (e.g. eth1 and eth2, or eth4 and eth5) that allow access to the domU client network 
defined in OEDA are discovered, configured, and brought up, but no IP is assigned
In the dom0, bondeth0 master interface is configured and brought up, but no IP is assigned
In the dom0, bridge interface vmbondeth0 is configured, but no IP is assigned
In the dom0, one virtual backend interface (vif) per domU that maps to that particular domUâ€™s bondeth0 interface is 
configured and brought up, but no IP is assigned.  These vif(s) are configured on top of the bridge interface vmbondeth0 
and the mapping between the dom0 vif interface and its corresponding user domain interface bondeth0 is defined in the 
user domain configuration file called vm.cfg, which can be found in /EXAVMIMAGES/GuestImages/<user domain name>.
